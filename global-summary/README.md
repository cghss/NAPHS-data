# Global summary of JEE and NAPHS data
As defined by [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/operations/international-health-regulations-monitoring-evaluation-framework/national-action-plan-for-health-security), a "National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS) is a country owned, multi-year, planning process that can accelerate the implementation of IHR core capacities, and is based on a One Health for all-hazards, whole-of-government approach. It captures national priorities for health security, brings sectors together, identifies partners and allocates resources for health security capacity development."

This directory contains data associated with a project to assess the global status of JEE and NAPHS completion and data sharing as of February 2023. Publication is in process.

* **countries.tsv** dataset with one row per IHR member state ("country") with information on JEE and NAPHS completion, publication, and data sharing
* **data_dictionary.xlsx** data dictionary with additional information on datasets, including definitions for all fields 
* **graphic.R** code to explore data and create a number of basic summary graphics
